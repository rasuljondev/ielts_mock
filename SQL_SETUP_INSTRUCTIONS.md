# Grading System Database Setup

## You need to run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

To fix the "Could not find the 'auto_grading_data' column" error, you need to run the `setup_grading_system.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor.

### Steps:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content of `setup_auto_grading_system.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

### What this adds:

- `reading_score`, `listening_score`, `writing_score`, `total_score` columns to test_submissions
- `graded_at`, `graded_by`, `feedback`, `auto_grading_data` columns for grading metadata
- Tables for listening and writing sections (if needed)
- Proper constraints and indexes

After running this SQL, the grading system will work correctly.

## Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed Answer Matching**: Made the matching logic more strict

   - "child" vs "childs" will now be correctly marked as wrong
   - Only exact word matches are allowed for flexibility
   - Short answers (1-2 chars) require exact match

2. **Added Manual Override**:

   - Admin can now manually mark questions correct/wrong in the detailed review tab
   - "Mark Correct" / "Mark Wrong" buttons for each question
   - Manual overrides show a "Manual Override" badge
   - Scores automatically recalculate when overrides are applied

3. **Database Schema**: The SQL setup will add all necessary columns for grading
